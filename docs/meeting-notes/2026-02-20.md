# Supervisor Meeting 20.02

Available donors that haven't been donating <- remind them

Decision logic (not really algorithmic)
Not only CRUD, reasoning needed

- Low on blood reserves: 
    - Query DB of Users 
    - take in account donation frequency 
    - Only notify users that are "available" to donate again also important monitor blood quality and take in account
    - Then take "likely" donors in account -> usually donate on this day etc.
    - Don't call people that don't always agree frequently (someone who only donates every 6 month, don't notify every 3 months)


In practice done via mail
