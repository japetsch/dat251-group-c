## Feedback from Rogart

Comments:
- Final report is the graded one. Supervision and intermediate assignments is for support.
- Absolutely sufficient to have a MVP that does a better job than current solutions, not actually integrating it with the hospitals.
- Scheduling is the natural algorithm. Objects are people, places, etc.
- Teamwork is the most important in the beginning.
- Exam (+its papers) mostly based on what we do in the papers
- Chat with Helse Vest IKT (Kronstad X)
- Other sources of data than interview: survey?
