Summary: milestones achieved / agreements reached:
- Solicited feedback from Rogart regarding blood bank project idea
- Created git repo for documentation and future code
- Created shared Overleaf document for report
- We're trying to get started early with assignment 1, since it seems like a decent amount of work
- We'll write short notes after each meeting to refer back to in report
- All members will maintain their own individual logbooks for "time spent, tasks completed, and reflections" (quote from the slides) on the project
- Design Thinking and Software Sustainability Framework seems like the most important tools to know for assignment 1
- Sara and Tamara will take the main responsibility for conducting interviews for assignment 1
- In our next meeting, we will decide on an idea and start the process of booking interviews

The meeting started with exploring the previously suggested blood bank idea, specifically what already existing systems are available, and their limitations.

The group also had a longer brainstorming session for finding project ideas.
After a formal voting process, the blood bank and food combination ideas we're the most popular with the group.

After having discussed and voting on ideas we decided to solicit feedback regarding the viability of the blood bank project, as we were less confident it fit the requirements than the food combination idea.
Finally, we made decisions regarding practical matters of project organization, itemized at the top of this document.
