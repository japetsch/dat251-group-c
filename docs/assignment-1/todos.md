# Initial project pre-study
Overarching process: design thinking (Stanford d.school)
- Only alluded to in the description: double diamond model

Understanding the Domain and Users:
- Design thinking "Empathize" phase
- Double diamond: first divergence
- Three interviews + relevant literature review identifying similar systems

Capturing Insights:
- Design thinking "Define" phase
	- (Might produce multiple problem statements)
- Double diamond: first convergence
- Personas, domain models, activity diagrams
- Sustainability: use selected tools from SAF paper

Ideation Phase:
- Design thinking "Ideate" phase
- Double diamond: rediverge

Focusing on Your Project Idea:
- Design thinking "Prototype" phase (Make prototypes! Validate)
	- DT "Testing" phase also integrated here???
- Double diamond: reconverge
- Realistic, well-scoped project idea
- Might be revisited during actual development (later assignments)

Business Canvas or Lean Canvas:
- Complete either technique.

Defining Requirements:
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- User stories (initial backlog technique)

Reflections based on Literature:
- Integrate the five papers into report writing
- DT and SAF most relevant during the process, should be read before the applicable steps

# Report
Reflection > concretes. Refer to the template.
Effectiveness of the tools.

Define:
- System objective
- Intended users
- How it enhances their lives
- Contributions to a more (environmentally and socially) sustainable world
