## Questions and answers (translated from Norwegian)

### Motivation

#### How and why did you start donating blood?
Wants to give something back to society. It could be family or friends who one day need blood, and it feels good to know that you have contributed to helping someone.

#### How often do you donate blood?
Maximum 4 times a year.*

#### How did you find out where you could donate blood?
Through family and by finding information independently.

#### Do you feel that the system gives you good and clear information about the requirements for donating blood?
Yes, but the information is spread across several platforms. Some is found on websites, some on YouTube, and some in the app.

#### Do you feel the system is clear enough for you to find the information you need?
Yes, but it is somewhat time-consuming.

#### What are the requirements for donating blood?
- Completion of a health declaration/questionnaire (must be completed every time)
- Interview with a nurse/bioengineer
- Blood tests  
  - More tests during the first donation  
  - Testing before every donation (HIV, hepatitis, iron, etc.)
- Information is available, among other places, via YouTube videos

### The process of registering as a blood donor

#### How did you register as a blood donor?
Via the app. Had to call to change the appointment and received the appointment invitation via SMS.

#### What do you experience as the biggest difficulties in the process, and what would you change?
It was inconvenient to have to call the reception. I waited over 20 minutes before getting an answer. It is possible to change appointments via the website, but this was not clearly stated in the SMS.

#### What are you satisfied with, or what do you think works well in the current solution?
There is room for improvement. The user experience could be better, for example with:
- Login using BankID
- Personal user profile
- Overview of previous donations
- Information about what the blood is used for
- Statistics on number of donations and potentially lives saved

#### How would your ideal booking system work?
Login with BankID in the app, with the ability to book and change appointments directly there.

---

### The process of being an active blood donor

#### Are you summoned to donate blood from your local blood donation center?
You book an appointment yourself when it suits you best, since you know when you are healthy or have been traveling. You may also be summoned if there is a need for blood.

#### How do you agree on a time?
Appointment booking is sent via SMS, where you confirm with “YES” or “NO”.

#### How can you change or cancel the appointment?
Via the app, which redirects you to a web portal.

---

### Blood Donation

#### Which blood bank do you donate blood to?
Bergen – Haukeland University Hospital.

---

### Appointment

#### How do you manage your appointments today?
You are summoned.

#### How do you know when and where to show up?
You receive information via SMS.

---

### Additional Information

- **Mathilde:** Was informed that the blood she donated went to the neonatal intensive care unit.

## Questions and answers (translated from Norwegian)

### Motivation

#### How and why did you start donating blood?
I wanted to learn a bit more about myself and was encouraged to donate blood by fellow students. After that, both the mug and the opportunity to help others became a motivation to continue.

#### How often do you donate blood?
Donated blood a total of 7 times between 2021 and 2023 before moving to Kongsberg. Have not donated blood since.

#### How did you find out where you could donate blood?
First through fellow students, then via information on the local hospital’s website.

#### Do you feel that the system gives you good and clear information about the requirements for donating blood?
No. In 2021, I received no information beyond “are you healthy” before attending the introductory appointment. During the introduction, I had to fill out a very extensive form with questions it would have been useful to prepare for in advance. I had to call both my parents and partner while filling out the form.

#### Do you feel the system is clear enough for you to find the information you need?
No.

#### What are the requirements for donating blood?
- **Health declaration / questionnaire:**  
  A very detailed form with many questions about personal health, partner, and parents – much of which you do not necessarily know in advance.
- **Blood tests:**  
  Yes, but I did not know that you could not donate blood during the introductory appointment. Only blood samples were taken, and I had to return after the tests were approved.

### The process of registering as a blood donor

#### How did you register as a blood donor?
I had to wait in a phone queue for the local hospital’s phone line. This took about 15 minutes the first time. After that, I had to reply “yes” or “no” via SMS to confirm the appointment.

#### What do you experience as the biggest difficulties in the process, and what would you change?
- A terrible and outdated system with reception desks, phone queues, and SMS confirmations.
- No available appointments outside working hours, which makes it very difficult for working people to donate blood.
- This contributes to a shortage of blood donors – not because people do not want to donate, but due to system failures.

#### What are you satisfied with, or what do you think works well in the current solution?
Nothing. I feel that the management in Helsenorge clings to solutions because “that’s how it’s always been.”

#### How would your ideal booking system work?
Everything should function in one shared app for the entire country:
1. Login with BankID
2. “Start registration”
3. Choice of registration location  
   - It feels unnecessary that you can only be registered at one blood bank at a time
4. Selection of available appointment via calendar
5. Completion of questionnaire 6 hours before the appointment
6. Arrival 10 minutes before the scheduled time  
   - With notifications in case of delays (e.g., staff illness)
7. Interview with a nurse
8. Blood tests
9. Confirmation and invitation to a new appointment if tests are approved  
   - In case of rejection, you can try again after 3 months

The questionnaire and blood test results should be available across all blood banks in Norway.

---

### The process of being an active blood donor

#### Are you summoned to donate blood from your local blood donation center?
Yes, if I am registered.

#### How do you agree on a time?
Via a messaging system. If the time does not fit, I have to wait over 15 minutes in a phone queue.

#### How can you change or cancel the appointment?
By calling or replying “no” to the message.

---

### Blood Donation

#### Which blood bank do you donate blood to?
None at the moment. Trying to register in Kongsberg.

---

### Appointment

#### How do you manage your appointments today?
I do not donate blood at the moment.

#### How do you know when and where to show up?
Not applicable, as I am not currently donating blood.

---

### How should the system be?

- Blood donation buses that visit workplaces
- One shared app for the entire country:
  - Login with BankID
  - “Start appointment booking”
  - Automatic blocking of booking if you have donated blood within the last 3 months
  - Choice of location and available appointment via calendar
  - Questionnaire completed 6 hours before the appointment
- Shared access to questionnaires and blood test results across blood banks
- Notifications in case of delays
- After donation:
  - Choose a gift
  - Receive iron supplements and a drink
  - Receive a “welcome back” message after 3 months
- **Bonus:** Notification when your blood has helped someone

Having to start the entire process over again after 2–3 years without donating is very demotivating. The same applies to phone queues. People move often, and the system handles this poorly.

---

### Incident

Erlend wanted to become a blood donor in Kongsberg and called the local blood bank. He was still registered in the system in Stavanger, where he studied and first started donating blood. He was referred back to Stavanger to be deleted from the system. After renewed contact with Kongsberg, an entirely new user had to be created.

---

## The process of registering as a blood donor

### How did you register as a blood donor?
- I called the blood bank, and the person I spoke with scheduled an appointment and entered it into their booking system.

### What did you experience as the biggest difficulties in the process, and what would you possibly change?
- No difficulties at the time; they answered quickly and the process was simple.  
- The capacity of the phone lines was so good that I never had to wait in a queue.

### What were you satisfied with, or what do you think worked well?
- It took a short time before they answered the phone, and everything was set up to make it easy to give blood.
- I got free parking, so it did not cost me anything to give blood.
- If I had to pay for parking, the blood bank would reimburse the cost.
- We also received an amount of 50–100 NOK each time we gave blood.
- We received soda/biscuits/iron tablets if necessary.
- Call the nearest blood bank.
- They set up an appointment for you.
- If you had to cancel or change an appointment, you had to call them.
- When you show up to give blood, you are asked questions, then you give blood.
- When you are finished donating, you go to the counter and a new appointment is set up immediately.
- Then you already know when your next appointment is.

---

## How would your ideal booking system work?

- The most important thing is that the process feels fast and simple, since this is something you do voluntarily.
- Since you are using your personal time, it should not be necessary to wait or feel that the process is slow.
- It should not cost you anything to get there.
- Available parking.
- The only thing you need to give is your blood.

### Login and booking
- You log in with personal identification number and address.
- When the app has access to your place of residence, you can get suggestions for the nearest blood bank.
- Simple calendar system for booking.
- The booking system should work exactly like booking a doctor’s appointment through HelseNorge.
- Get quick responses and access to an app.

### App features
- Log in to the blood bank
  - Send a request for an appointment.
  - Be able to change appointments in the app.
  - Answer questions in the app.
    - If you have to go through something extra, you get feedback on this and additional questions in the app.
    - There should also be the possibility of a video interview for first-time donors.
- If you are an approved blood donor at one blood bank, you should be approved at all.
- Get a certificate in the app confirming that you are a blood donor.

### Emergency situations
- Emergency alarm in the app if there is an urgent need for blood.
- We need your blood before your scheduled appointment.
- Queue system of 10 people.
- Send out a message when they have found someone.
- If you do not get a response within a certain time, the next step is to call.
- Set the limit at one hour.

### Feedback and information
- Get feedback on your blood values in the app.

#### Interviewee opinion on receiving information about what your blood is used for:
- General information about how blood is used, but nothing more than that.
- Thinks it is not appropriate.
- Creates work for an information officer.
- That is not what my tax money should be used for.
- If people are willing to pay, then they can.
- But that is outside the system.
- Good stories about why giving blood is necessary on the website/app, but not for each individual.

---

## Notes from Sara
- We discussed that the systems should work exactly like how pharmacies operate.
- If you log in to HelseNorge, you can renew prescriptions immediately.
- You can also go to any pharmacy (regardless of owner) in the country to pick up the prescription.
- The systems work well together and everyone has access to your prescriptions.
- If appointment systems worked in the same way, where you can log in through HelseNorge and all blood banks in Norway have access to the booking system, even though the blood banks have different owners (Red Cross, different hospitals, etc.).

- He also discussed that there is a difference between students and those who are working.
- Those who are working have more resources to be able to give blood (e.g., money if they have to travel).
- Students are financially limited.
- Referring to what was discussed about free parking and that the system should be free and simple.

- In the app, it should be easy to move between systems.
- Since blood banks have different owners (hospital blood banks, Red Cross owns several as well), the app should be able to navigate between these systems in the same way prescriptions work.
- Different owners, but everyone retrieves information from the same system.

## The process of being an active blood donor

### Were you called in to give blood by your local blood donation center? How did you agree on a time?
- Every time I gave blood, the appointment was scheduled at the counter before I left.
- So I knew when I would give blood next time.

### How could you change or cancel the appointment?
- If the appointment did not fit, I could call them and we agreed on a new time over the phone.

---

## Blood donation

### Which blood bank did you give blood to? Did you have to change blood banks during the time you gave blood?
- Mostly gave blood in central Oslo (Ullevål Hospital).
- Otherwise, I gave blood in the medical corps in the military.

---

## Appointment

### How did you manage your appointments?
- They were scheduled every time I was at the blood bank to give blood.

### How did you know when and where to show up?
- In the very beginning, I received mail.
- Then I wrote it down in a calendar (before messaging systems existed).
- Eventually, I received confirmation by message.

### How could you change or cancel an appointment?
- I had to call them.

### Did you have to notify them when you could no longer give blood?
- I asked; since I got a blood clot when I was 50, I had to stop giving blood.

---

## Notes
- Interview HelseNorge and how their booking system works.
- Legal information? Since they have to log in with personal identification number.
