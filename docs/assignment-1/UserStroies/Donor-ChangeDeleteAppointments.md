# Change/delete appointments

As a blood donor (registered user),
I want to be able to change and delete my upcoming appointments,
so that I can react to changes in my schedule.

## Acceptance criteria

- Update time and location of an appointment
    - Additional checks that the changes are valid (no overlap with other appointments)
- Delete appointment
- Update appointment requirements (user has gotten sick since the booking etc.)
